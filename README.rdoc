Project implement basic ActiveRecord and ActiveRelation functionality for JSON files as DB.

<p>What you need to do it's just add custom model for JSON file to app/services, inherit it from Ng::ActiveRecord and add 'attr_available' for all field which you have in JSON file</p>
<p>After that you will be able to use standart methods like - all, where, matches and they will work like default methods in ActiveRecord</p>
<p>You should keep in mind that methods 'where' support inclusive searching and negative searching(for that type of searching you need just add '-' character before word or words)</p>
<p>Web interface include two possible type of searching - Global searching and Field searching.</p>
<p>First one(Global searching) - will be search by all fields in json file</p>
<p>Second one(Field searching) - this is more complex. it allow you to include negative searching and searching in specified fields</p>
